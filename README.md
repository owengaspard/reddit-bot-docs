# The Reddit Bot?

We have all seen those Text To Speech videos on YouTube and TikTok, right? Well, those low effort videos can be completely automated now! Using this Reddit Bot, you can produce a high quality video that is TikTok & YouTube ready in less than 5 (to 10) minutes with almost no effort.

All the credit for this bot's development goes to Lewis Menelaws. Get in touch with Lewis and his server filled with a bunch of lovely developers [here](https://discord.gg/5uw4eCQf6Z).

This simple documentation will guide you through the installation process of the bot & its required source files and get you running in no time! As of now, this documentation is restricted to Windows but you can give it a shot on MacOS and there is a high chance it'll work with you facing no issues.

Psst. If you want to contribute to the documentation here's the link. [https://github.com/LukaHietala/reddit-bot-docs](https://github.com/LukaHietala/reddit-bot-docs)
